<!-- WOW one-liner -->
<strong>I don’t “code” projects… I engineer ecosystems that self-correct, self-coordinate, and ship.</strong>

## 🧠 What I build
I’m building **Dream.OS**… a self-healing automation engine that runs **multi-agent swarms** inside Cursor via `.prompt.md` pipelines.

- **Swarm Execution:** 8+ agents acting in parallel (with escalation only on real blockers)
- **Governance:** SSOT, validation rituals, test gates, drift prevention
- **Reliability:** “act → self-correct → converge” feedback loops
- **Outcome:** faster iteration **without** turning the codebase into a landfill

---

## 🚀 Start here
- **Watch a 2-min demo:** request the private link → https://github.com/Victor-Dixon/Dream.os/issues/new?title=Demo%20request
- **Read the architecture overview:** Dream.OS README → https://github.com/Victor-Dixon/Dream.os#readme
- **Try the flagship repo:** Dream.OS → https://github.com/Victor-Dixon/Dream.os

## 🪄 WOW FACTOR
### ✅ I ingested and unlocked **1,310** ChatGPT conversations into a pipeline for:
- **SQLite memory nexus**
- searchable episode indexing
- resume + project extraction
- narrative “MMORPG-style” progression tied to real work

If you want the future of software… it’s **memory + orchestration + guardrails**.

## 🧰 Active Systems
- Dream.OS / WeAreSwarm — agent orchestration + self-healing automation
- Memory Nexus — SQLite + JSON tiered memory manager
- Validation Rituals — domain test suites gating stabilization
- Agent Cell Phone — PyAutoGUI-based inter-agent comms inside Cursor
- Trading Journal Engine — structured logs → analytics → strategy evolution

Want a “single command” that bootstraps order out of chaos… that’s my lane.

---

## 🧪 Principles (non-negotiable)
- Closure-first: every session ends with a clean next action
- No drift: systems evolve, they don’t sprawl
- No fragile magic: validate, test, log, repeat
- Automation wins: manual work is a bug

---

## 🤝 How to work with me
- **Open to:** consulting/advisory, multi-agent orchestration, automation pipelines, validation guardrails
- **Best contact:** open a short issue in Dream.OS → https://github.com/Victor-Dixon/Dream.os/issues/new
- **Include:** goal, current stack, timeline, constraints, and success metric

<summary><b>📎 “If you only read one thing…”</b></summary>

I’m not chasing “better prompts.”
I’m building operational leverage: systems that keep moving even when the UI changes, requirements shift, or humans get tired.

If you’re building in the real world… you need orchestration, validation, and memory.
